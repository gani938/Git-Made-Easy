git branch "branch_name" // create branch
git checkout "switch_branch_name" // switch branch
git checkout -b "branch_name" // create and switch to new branch

git branch -d "branch_name" //simple delete
git branch -D "branch_name" //force delete before merge
git branch -a //list all branches

git add . // add all changed files to staging
git commit -m "commit msg" // commit staged changes to branch

------
merging and conflicts-> 
Threeway merge or recursive merge-> scenario in which working branch took a separate path, had some commits 
and in mean time master branch had some commits and moved forward.



assume master branch present with styles.css with data 
body{
    color:red;
}

git checkout -b "feature-a"
git checkout master

update styles.css with data
body{
    color:red;
    margin:20px
}

git add .
git commit -m "margin added"

git checkout feature-a
update styles.css with data
body{
    color:red;
    padding:20px
}

To merge feature-a into master, go to master branch
git checkout master
git merge feature-a
// now you will get conflicts in master branch files. Here styles.css. Delete the comments in that file and put which data you want.
// now resolving conflits is done. Now just commit on master branch is enough as we have already given the message

git commit

--------------------------------------

Fast forward merge-> scenario in which working branch made checkout from master, did mutliple 
commits and moved forward. But the master branch is still pointing to the same last commit it had and
didn't move forward. So we can directly merge working branch in to master without any conflicts.

Git checkout master
Assume we have styles.css in master with data
body{
    color:red;
}
Git checkout -b "feature-b"
Update styles.css with data
body{
    color:red;
    margin:20px;
}
git add .
git commit -m "marging added"

Update styles.css with data
body{
    color:red;
    margin:20px;
    padding:20px;
}
git add .
git commit -m "padding added"

Now to merge feature-b into master, goto master
git checkout master
git merge feature-b


---------------------
Github contribution doubt

remote master cloned to local master. local master checkout to branch feature-c. 
feature-c requirement coded, pushed as remote branch to origin, raised a pulll request 
from feature-c origin to master origin. Pull request was not merged instantly.
Meanwhile on origin master, someone else has pushed their changes. So now master has moved forward.
In this case how do I merge my old pull request from feature-c origin to master origin?
